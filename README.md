# Designing and Building a Leather Wallet _with no experience!_
###### The TLDR;
__Skip this if you want to read through my entire build__
I was fed up with my wallet. I dodn't want to go buy a new one that wasn't exactly what I wanted and would break in just a couple months. I started out doing research into what wallets actally lasted a long time. I was not interested in minimalist wallets and limited my search to bifolds. This quickly brought me to leather wallets. Long story short, I decided to build my own wallet that would hopefully be exactly what I needed, awesome looking, and super durable. 

To fund this project, I'm doing it as a Passionate Pursuit at [Olin College of Engineering](https://www.olin.edu/) where I'm a sophomore. Passionate pursuits give students small amounts of money ($150 USD) to work on a personal project for a singular credit. I received $80 to fund this venture!

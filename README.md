# Designing and Building a Leather Wallet _with no experience!_
###### The TLDR;
__Skip this if you want to read through my entire build__
I was fed up with my wallet. I dodn't want to go buy a new one that wasn't exactly what I wanted and would break in just a couple months. I started out doing research into what wallets actally lasted a long time. I was not interested in minimalist wallets and limited my search to bifolds. This quickly brought me to leather wallets. Long story short, I decided to build my own wallet that would hopefully be exactly what I needed, awesome looking, and super durable. 

To fund this project, I'm doing it as a Passionate Pursuit at [Olin College of Engineering](https://www.olin.edu/) where I'm a sophomore. Passionate pursuits give students small amounts of money ($150 USD) to work on a personal project for a singular credit. I received $80 to fund this venture!

# Intro

###### Who?
I'm Nathan! I'm currently a sophomore at Olin College of Engineering studying Robotics and/or Computer Science.
I'm grew up in a small town outside Eugene, Oregon and lived on a very small farm. In my spare time you can find me hiking, backpacking, camping, driving, or fixing one of my 6 bikes. 

###### Why?
I've recently discovered what an awesome material leather is! This started with a vintage Brooks bike seat. Brooks hasn't changed their design significantly for ~100 years. Suprisingly, the properties of leather that allow it to conform to your body over time make leather seats some of the comfiest and longest lasting bike seats you can get. Of course there are some downsides to having a leather saddle, one being weight, the other being that you need to take care of it/keep it dry. 
I now own 3 leather bike seats and recently purchased a matching leather saddle bag and set of handlebar tape...
The other thing I love about leather is the look. As time goes on it develops it's own character and looks super [awesome](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TsSMcWUpLpedH86FTDdV_AnCDwc7hqg0HogkUjp_fgqxgPJNdHBizdFNZrRxcUpabtC273f1mjF2QO4xaGj5o39F84qyEdXrZaNAaZB4ENxBbtR2810W63A6sDH8ZY0c2v9cHfLwMO5xcM_xTTwAVYxA23GK97LZ5zXOgq_mzgjTYkVzY0_ZtQQmsFkShp72L9WbXM2VXV7cPRCK52JNCsIwpvehp47bxunFLr4vMZnG5-LpO9c2vtsDC_QYGJFoeZNDXUgKxfAsdXHVDtBuLBDzOqDAuOdlKw2UZ4nMdXgB6x5YVf3pUYTkxWTBmvFqtv8XnCI4g492QaA-AXQJNSmc964rEGiXqMXGeBtiIODuQusRancbzTIQqt1KH0-Vn99HP4KV6LqToCEiE_zxfcwPvDo-VdzX9PBg2SRsG84RhAPR0OR9B2Z_Gxjm2cxfWjBuUvOabkH3jfCwsZRT2Udqd8HQS_8n7nGleaj1OlvuLjVmEJrxZdzz8W5XjZVTuYdnvQVN9Gfdy674zhDz5TrHg8eLYMPufKHGDrdoOlw81eRHehEBROz969oRXTbnMwwTslM1U0jmr7e7za-bhbsnyKyli4U37tdOOQy8Ln3tfLy-wjkt3HZ75_74VDgFL8_HyChat1239LK3ECECyz3NEB6g6kTmZ0tPLGFMySqgcV3ffgi4k-7Nn7YhIA=w875-h656-no?authuser=0)

So why did I decide to try and make a leather wallet? Well, my old wallet started breaking. It was nothign fancy, I actually still use it (somehow it hasn't broken any more) it probably cost $10 at a department store. I always thought that leather wallets were top of the line (try googling "fancy men's wallet"). This prompted me into doing a lot of research about what makes a good wallet. At some point I ended up where all searches lead to: Reddit. In all seriousness this subreddit is pretty cool [r/BuyItForLife](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/). Leather wallets made several appearances here and with even more research I found that I was really after something that I wouldn't need to replace anytime soon. I also spent a good amount of time on [Saddleback Leather](https://saddlebackleather.com/) looking at their wallets, and didn't feel like any of them were exactly what I wanted. I also didn't want to spend a ton of money.

This prompted me to look into how hard it was to make a wallet from leather, my sister had just made one from Tyvek so I thought this was probably doable.
Google was quite amaxing and showed me many vidoes of people makng simple bifolds. The hardest parts definitely looked to be coming up with the design, and using the proper materials and tools.

Obviously I could have bought a custom leather wallet off Etsy for cheaper than I will be able to make one. However, I'm really after the sense of pride of making something that I can carry with me for the rest of my life.

###### Constraints
If you haven't realized by now, I'm particular. What would be the point of building your own wallet if it wasn't exactly what you wanted.
The constraints/desing goals of this wallet are:
- Not too thick as to go in my back pocket, I usually keep mine in my front pocket put this wallet can't be a brick
    - Empty thickness <= 12.5mm
- Enough car pockets for all my cards >= 6
- Secure in that things don't fall out
- No coin purse etc
- Good spot for ID that is easy access
- Spot for other import cards that don't come out often (insurance cards, library gift cards)

### Research
I know almost nothing about leatherworking. This spurred many hours of reading across the internet. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what tools I would need, what various types of leather are, how one actually constructs a wallet, and how other wallets are designed.

#### A summary of thoughts collected:
###### Leather
Leather is a very complex material. There are many different processes used to tan the leather, and there are many different cuts of leather. There also many other dying processes that change the leather. The first bit of leather learning was about different parts of the hide. There is a ton of lingo surrounding leather. 
_Top grain:_ Top part of the leather with some shaved off (Second best cut) 

_Full grain:_ Includes very top of hide(most expensive/durabel cut)

_Suede:_ lower less desirable part of hide

_Genuine:_ Also less desirable part of hide

Key points
- OZ is used to describe thickness of leather (not neccesarily how pliable it is)
- Tooling leather is generally harder

### Materials

I ended up ordering a 10x10 square of 4-5oz and a 12x12 of 2/3oz
the 4-5 oz measures ~2.2mm, the 2-3 measures ~1mm

So this means that a wallet with 1 backing layer and 5 thinner layers one each side would be 2.2mm + 5*1mm. this would yield something 15mm thick.

With appropriate skiving and maybe one less layer of leather on one side, this should reach my goal
